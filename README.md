# Welcome to My üå•Ô∏è Cloud Playground üéÆ 

Here, you'll find a collection of my cloud computing projects, ranging from small research experiments to large-scale solutions. Most of the projects are housed in the playground directory, while many are also linked from my other repositories. You can explore them through the list below, which is categorized by different domains.

Enjoy exploring!

## üöÄ Projects: 

- **[Securely Share AMI Across AWS Account Using Python](playground/share-aws-ami-cross-account)** [AWS Compute]
  - Securely share your AMI across AWS accounts, along with an automated solution built using Python.

- **[Building High-Resilient AWS VPC Architecture](https://github.com/alonshrestha/aws-vpc-resilient-architecture)** [AWS Security]
  - Minimal setup for a highly resilient AWS VPC architecture, focusing on availability, security, and cost-efficiency. 

- **[AWS IAM Key Rotation Automation Using Pyhton](https://github.com/alonshrestha/aws-iam-key-rotation-boto3)** [AWS Security]
  - Automates AWS IAM key rotation, enforces security policies, and supports multiple accounts with targeted exclusions and email notifications.

- **[AWS Secret Rotation Automation Script for EC2 DB and RDS Using Python](https://github.com/alonshrestha/aws-database-secret-rotation-boto3)** [AWS Security, AWS Serverless]
  - This project extends the AWS sample script to automate AWS secret credential rotation for MariaDB and MySQL, incorporating compatibility, email notifications, and efficient management of secret versions using AWS Secrets Manager and Lambda functions. 

- **[AWS ACM Expiration Alert Automation Using Python](https://github.com/alonshrestha/aws-acm-expire-alerts-boto3)** [AWS Security]
  - Automates monitoring of ACM certificate expiration across multiple AWS accounts, sending email alerts via AWS SES when certificates are within 30 days of expiration. Utilizes AWS IAM roles and STS AssumeRole for secure cross-account access.

- **[Home Healthcare Website](https://github.com/alonshrestha/dhcs)** [Web Developement]
  - Developed and deployed website in open-source cloud for a Nepal-based home health care service, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Created original content, conducted research, and implemented SEO strategies, including local optimization of the Google My Business listing. 

- **[AWS EC2 Patching Automation Using Lambda, SSM, Python](https://github.com/alonshrestha/aws-ec2-patch-automation-boto3)** [AWS Security, AWS Serverless]
  - This application provides a flexible patching automation script designed to patch AWS EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager.  

## üß™ Research and Experiments:

- **[Implementing AWS Network Firewall](https://cloudwith.alon.com.np/implementing-aws-network-firewall)** [AWS Security]
  - This research focuses on implementing AWS Network Firewall to resolve scalability issues in securing EC2 instances. The existing architecture faced limitations with AWS Security Groups, which couldn't handle growing IP whitelisting needs. AWS Network Firewall was deployed as a scalable solution to manage traffic and enhance security, addressing these constraints effectively.

- **[Linux Boot Process in AWS EC2 Instance](https://cloudwith.alon.com.np/how-linux-boots-on-aws-ec2-instance)** [Linux]
  - Walk through the basic steps of the Linux boot process on an AWS EC2 instance to provide a clear understanding of how it works.  

- **[Understanding AWS Data Transfer Cost](https://cloudwith.alon.com.np/understanding-aws-data-transfer-costs)** [AWS Cost Optimization]
  - Details on AWS data transfer costs, covering billing principles, cost-saving strategies, and ways to reduce expenses for data transfers within, into, and out of AWS.    

- **[AWS Cross-Account Access with AWS STS Assume Role](https://cloudwith.alon.com.np/automate-cross-account-access-using-sts-assume-role)** [AWS Cost Optimization]
  - Learn how to use AWS STS AssumeRole to securely access resources in a cross-account setup for automation running from your master account.

- **[Scanning Vulnerabilities on EC2 Instance Using AWS Inspector](https://cloudwith.alon.com.np/scanning-vulnerabilities-on-ec2-instance-using-aws-inspector)** [AWS Security]
  - Experimenting with AWS Inspector for scanning vulnerabilities on EC2 instances. Includes information about setup, scanning methods, vulnerability details, and cost optimization strategies.

- **[Choosing Right AWS EC2 Dynamic Scaling Policies](https://cloudwith.alon.com.np/choosing-right-aws-ec2-dynamic-autoscaling-policies)** [AWS Compute]
  - An analysis of Simple, Step, and Target-Tracking scaling policies, including their use cases, setup strategies, and guidance on choosing the ideal policy for managing an AWS Auto Scaling group.
